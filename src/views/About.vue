                    SunScreen is a web app that uses the screen to emulate
                    various natural and artificial light sources. It fills the
                    background of the browser window with their typical
                    representations in the RGB color space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's intended use is for video calls in a two-monitor setup.
                    On one screen you can run the video call, while the unused
                    monitor can improve the lighting.
