[sun-screen](https://sunscreen.marcelsuter.ch) is a web app to improve the lighting in home office or
conference video calls. In a dual monitor setup, on one screen you
can run the video call, while the second monitor improves the
lighting of your face. You can also use it as background light.

It works by using the computer or device screen to emulate various
natural sky conditions (high noon sunlight, overcast, clear blue
sky) and artificial light bulbs (incandescent, fluorescent and
others). It fills the full screen background of the browser window
with their representations in the RGB color space. You can slide
between two colors to adapt for lighting changes during the day.
