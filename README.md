# sun-screen

SunScreen is a web app that uses the screen to emulate
various natural and artificial light sources. It fills the
background of the browser window with their typical
representations in the RGB color space.

It's intended use is for video calls in a two-monitor setup.
On one screen you can run the video call, while the unused
monitor can improve the lighting.
